# Task

I have implemented the task using following technologies 

Frontend : ReactJs

Backend : Nodejs

Database : Mongodb

In backend index.js is the main file and you can start the server using the command **node index.js** and before that install all the packages that are used. And coming to frontend to start the react app use the command **npm start** before that install all the packages used.

When both the frontend and backend are started visit the **localhost:3000** to view the applications frontend now you can perform CRUD operations on the frontend and the data is sent to the backend using API's and neccessary operations are performed on users table.
